# Tweaker <sup><sub>Trackmania</sub></sup>
Plugin for OpenPlanet that helps modify in-game hidden settings (mostly visual) and slightly boost the performance.

## Disclaimer
This is a very early version of the plugin so only few features are available for now.

## Features

* Graphics tweaking
    * Render Distance (Z-Clip)
    * Level of Detail (LOD)

## Limitations
* *Render Distance* applies only if you are in the main menu or editor
* *Level of Detail* might differ depending on your graphics preset
* **Fog relies on draw distance**, therefore if fog is increased it might be impossible to see the whole map.
    * Disable *Render Distance* in this case
