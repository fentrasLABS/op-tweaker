# Tweaker <sup><sub>Trackmania</sub></sup>
Plugin for OpenPlanet that helps modify in-game hidden settings (mostly visual) and slightly boost the performance.

## Features

* Graphics tweaking
    * Render Distance (Z-Clip)
    * Level of Detail (LOD)

## Limitations
* To change *Render Distance* you must apply it first in the main menu or editor
    * It does not apply when you are in the game
* *Level of Detail* might differ depending on your graphics preset
* **Fog and ColorFX rely on _Render Distance_**, therefore these effects will make it almost impossible to see the whole map.
    * Disable *Render Distance* in this case
* Some settings can remain enabled even **if you disable or delete the plugin**
    * *Reset plugin settings* to default before disabling or uninstalling
